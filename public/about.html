<h2>Hi, I'm Muhamed Kaif K.</h2> 
<p>I'm currently pursuing my Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Science and Engineering (CSE), and I'm passionate about full-stack development. I’ve built a solid foundation in C, Python, and HTML, and I’m excited to expand my knowledge and skills in the tech field.

Aside from academics, I’m also deeply interested in dancing, which allows me to stay creative and active. I’m always looking to balance my technical pursuits with something expressive and fun.

I'm driven, committed to achieving my goals, and constantly looking for new challenges to learn and grow both academically and personally.
